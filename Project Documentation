Introduction
The online voting system is designed to facilitate a secure and efficient way for users to cast their votes remotely. This system aims to enhance the voting experience by providing a user-friendly interface while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process.
Objectives
- Enable users to register and log in securely.
- Provide a seamless interface for casting votes.
- Ensure that each vote is counted accurately.
- Maintain user privacy and data security.

Technologies Used
- Backend: Java, Servlets, JSP, JDBC
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- Database: MySQL
- Build Tool: Maven
- Development Environment: Eclipse IDE
- Testing Framework: JUnit

Interaction Diagram
- User Interface: Where users interact with the application.
- Servlets: Handle incoming requests and manage the interaction between the UI and the database.
- DAO Layer: Interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations.
- Database: Stores all the application data including user information and votes.

Table Schema
Example for users table:
| Column Name | Data Type  | Constraints                           |
|-------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| id          | INT        | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT           |
| name        | VARCHAR(50)| NOT NULL                              |
| email       | VARCHAR(100)| UNIQUE, NOT NULL                     |
| password    | VARCHAR(255)| NOT NULL                             |
Implementation Details
DAO Layer
The UserDAO interacts with the database using JDBC to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records. It abstracts database interactions for easier management.
Servlets
The UserServlet is responsible for handling user requests. 
- doGet: Retrieves data from the database and displays it to the user.
- doPost: Processes data submitted by users, such as registration or voting actions.
JSP Pages
- profile.jsp: Displays user profile information and allows updates.
- message.jsp: Shows messages to the user, such as success or error notifications.
JSTL and EL
JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) and EL (Expression Language) are used to simplify the JSP code, making it easier to access data and control flow.
Testing
Testing is conducted using JUnit to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application. Unit tests are written for individual components, including servlets and DAO methods.
Deployment
The application can be deployed on a web server like Apache Tomcat. Steps include building the project using Maven, packaging it as a WAR file, and deploying it to the server.
Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge: Ensuring data security.
- Solution: Implement robust encryption for stored passwords and secure connections.

- Challenge: Handling concurrent votes.
- Solution: Use database transactions to manage concurrent access and maintain data integrity.
Future Enhancements
- Implement multi-language support for broader accessibility.
- Enhance user interface with more interactive features.
- Introduce advanced analytics for voting trends.
Conclusion
The online voting system aims to provide a secure, user-friendly, and efficient way to conduct elections. With continued enhancements and robust testing, this system can significantly improve the voting experience.
